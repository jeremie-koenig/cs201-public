## Formatting

Because the syntax of Scheme is so uniform,
it is very important
that you organize your code on the page
in a way which makes its structure evident.
Most Scheme programmers employ the rules below.
If you adopt them,
you will never need to scan your code for matching parentheses;
instead, you will recognize the nesting
and content of an expression by the form of the code.


### Rule 1: Parens tend to feel lonely.

Don't put closing (or opening) parens on a line of their own. They get
lonely easily. Seriously, it's superfluous information and takes up
lines for nothing. Therefore, the following code is good Scheme style:

    (define (fac n)
      (if (zero? n)
          1
          (* n (fac (- n 1)))))

Notice the closing parens at the end. A seasoned schemer won't see
those, though - the expression ends there, the next one begins at
column zero, so he knows that everything is closed there.


### Rule 2: Indent subexpressions equally.

Basic indentation in Scheme is to indent subexpressions equally. This
is easiest seen in example:

    (list (foo)
          (bar)
          (baz))

As you can see, the expressions (foo), (bar) and (baz) are all lined
up under each other. They're all on the same syntactic level - all are
arguments to LIST - so they should be lined up under each other.

When you open a new line directly after the first expression of a
opening parenthesis, the following expressions belong on the column right of
the parenthesis. So the code above could also be written as:

    (list
     (foo)
     (bar)
     (baz))

There are exceptions - important ones, too. Some expressions, mostly
definition statements, get the body argument indented two spaces from
the definition. You have seen the canonical example, DEFINE, in the
first rule. LET is another example:

    (let ((pi 3.14)
          (r 120))
      (* pi r r))

Notice how the product is indented two spaces in respect to the LET
form above.

In general, Emacs' automatic indentation behavior does the right thing.


### Rule 3: Closing parens close the line.

As soon as you write a closing parenthesis in Scheme code, it usually means
that you add any further closing parenthesis, and then break the line and
start a new one:

    (+ (* 2 3)
       (/ 17 5))

Notice how the closing parenthesis in the product closes the line as well.
This is a good rule of thumb to avoid too complex forms on a line
which would be difficult to read.


### Rule 4: Break for one - break for all.

If you subexpressions onto multiple lines - for example due to
Rule 3 - put every subexpression on a single line.

For example, you can write

    (+ 1 foo bar baz)

but if one of those expressions gets more complicated, you may want it
on a line of its own. If so, put all of the subexpressions on lines
of their own:

    (+ 1
       (foo 3.5 a)
       bar
       baz)

If an argument list is broken, a seasoned schemer will expect to find
every argument on a line of its own, so putting more then one on any
of the lines will likely cause the extra argument to be missed.


### Rule 5: There are no rules.

All of these rules are guidelines. If you choose to break one, do so.
It's your code. But be aware that you are breaking one, and that you
have a good reason for doing so.


### Further information

These are the most important conventions. There are other important
ones, though.

When people are looking through your code, they are expecting to see
certain typographical notations to tell them more about what kind of
variable or procedure it is. For instance, type conversion uses
*old-type*`->`*new-type*. This sub-syntax for variable naming
is further described on [[variable-naming-convention]]

When writing your comments, try to follow good [[comment-style]].
